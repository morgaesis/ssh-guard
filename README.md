# guard

LLM-evaluated command gate for AI agents. Every command gets evaluated by a fast LLM call before execution. Approved commands run normally. Denied commands return an explanation.

```
$ guard run ls -la /etc/nginx/
drwxr-xr-x 8 root root 4096 Mar 10 14:22 .
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1482 Mar 10 14:22 nginx.conf

$ guard run rm -rf /etc/nginx/
DENIED: Recursive deletion of system config directory.
```

## Why

AI agents (Claude Code, Codex, Aider, OpenHands, CrewAI, etc.) increasingly need command execution access for debugging, log analysis, and ops tasks. A single hallucinated `rm -rf` or `kubectl delete namespace` can take down production.

Guard sits between the agent and the shell. Every command gets evaluated by an LLM (`openai/gpt-5.4-nano` via OpenRouter by default) before it reaches the system. The LLM analyzes intent and risk, not just pattern matching, so it catches obfuscated attacks and novel command chains that static policies miss.

Cost is negligible: each evaluation uses roughly 3600 prompt + 45 completion tokens, costing about $0.0005 per decision with `openai/gpt-5.4-nano`. A full 45-case CTF adversarial benchmark runs for about $0.02 total.

## Install

```bash
cargo install --path .
```

Or download a release artifact and install the binary manually.

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for install options and [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for service deployment.

## Quick start

```bash
# Set your API key (OpenRouter, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint)
export SSH_GUARD_LLM_API_KEY="your-key-here"

# Start the server
guard server start &

# Execute commands through the guard
guard run uptime
guard run cat /var/log/syslog
guard run ps aux

# These will be denied:
guard run rm -rf /tmp/*
guard run sudo su
```

To test policy decisions without executing approved commands, start a separate
dry-run server:

```bash
guard server start --dry-run --socket .cache/guard-dry-run.sock
guard server connect --socket .cache/guard-dry-run.sock bash -- -c 'sudo id'
```

## Modes

Set via `SSH_GUARD_MODE`:

| Mode | Description |
|---|---|
| `readonly` | Read-only evaluation. Blocks file writes, system or service state changes, package changes, privilege escalation, reverse shells, and obfuscated payloads. Allows routine inspection commands like `ls`, `ps`, `cat`, `grep`, `df`. |
| `safe` | Permissive administrative evaluation. Allows visible, bounded troubleshooting and admin work, but blocks credential-material reads, destructive operations, privilege escalation, unauthorized network pivots, and hidden payloads. |
| `paranoid` | Restrictive. Blocks writes, sensitive file reads, network connections, shells, interpreters, side-channel execution, and chained commands. Only allows basic non-sensitive inspection (`id`, `hostname`, `pwd`, `ls`, `ps`, `df`, limited `git status`). |

Use `readonly` when agents should investigate production state without changing
it. Use `safe` when an operator is supervising real sysadmin work and wants
bounded writes, targeted restarts, and ordinary maintenance to be possible while
still blocking destructive or credential-seeking commands. Use `paranoid` for
untrusted agents, adversarial testing, or first contact with an unfamiliar
workspace where even broad reads and network access should be treated as risky.

```bash
SSH_GUARD_MODE=safe guard run sudo systemctl status ssh --no-pager  # allowed
SSH_GUARD_MODE=paranoid guard run sudo systemctl status ssh --no-pager  # denied
```

All modes evaluate `sudo` by the underlying command:

```bash
guard run sudo ls /etc/nginx/        # readonly: allowed (read operation)
guard run sudo rm -rf /etc/nginx/    # readonly: denied  (destructive)
guard run sudo systemctl restart app # safe: allowed     (targeted restart)
```

## Configuration

### Defaults vs. opt-ins

Guard ships with an LLM-only evaluation pipeline: a single call to
`openai/gpt-5.4-nano` via OpenRouter, function-calling based, with two retries
before failing closed. No static allow or deny lists are loaded. No fallback
model chain is active. This default is production-ready for the common case.

Two opt-in features exist for deployments with specific constraints:

- **Static allow/deny lists** via `--policy <yaml>`. Short-circuits the LLM
  for deterministic safe or unsafe patterns. See
  [`examples/`](examples/README.md) for `allow-policy.yaml`,
  `deny-policy.yaml`, and `hybrid-policy.yaml`.
- **Fallback model chain** via `SSH_GUARD_LLM_MODELS`. Fails over to
  alternate providers after the primary exhausts its retries. See
  [`examples/fallback-models.env`](examples/fallback-models.env).

Enable either only when a concrete latency or uptime constraint forces it.

### Environment variables

All configuration via environment variables, CLI flags, or `.env` files.

Guard walks up from your current directory to `/` looking for `.env` files (closest wins), so you can scope config per project.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `SSH_GUARD_LLM_API_KEY` / `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | (none) | LLM API key (required). `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is the conventional name and is accepted for compatibility. |
| `SSH_GUARD_API_URL` | `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions` | Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint |
| `SSH_GUARD_LLM_MODELS` | (unset) | Optional comma-separated fallback chain (e.g. `openai/gpt-5.4-nano,meta-llama/llama-4-maverick`). When set, overrides `--llm-model` and is tried in order, each with its own retry budget. Primary model when unset: `openai/gpt-5.4-nano`. |
| `SSH_GUARD_LLM_RETRIES` | `2` | Retries per model on transient failures (429, timeouts, parse errors). 1-2. |
| `SSH_GUARD_MODE` | `readonly` | `readonly`, `safe`, or `paranoid` |
| `SSH_GUARD_DRY_RUN` | `false` | Evaluate policy but do not execute approved commands. Useful for prompt and policy testing. |
| `SSH_GUARD_PROMPT_APPEND` | (none) | Path to additive prompt file (appended to base prompt) |
| `SSH_GUARD_GPG_RECIPIENT` | (none) | GPG recipient for the `local` secret backend |
| `SSH_GUARD_BACKEND` | (auto) | Secret backend (`pass`, `env`, `local`). Auto prefers `pass`; otherwise it falls back to non-persistent `env` and logs a warning. |

The primary model is `openai/gpt-5.4-nano` via OpenRouter by default. Set it
per-invocation with `--llm-model <slug>`. To configure a true fallback chain
across providers, use `SSH_GUARD_LLM_MODELS` (comma-separated) or
`--llm-models`. `--llm-timeout <seconds>` controls the per-call HTTP timeout.

See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for a copyable template.

## Examples

### Basic server with readonly mode

Start the guard server and execute commands through it:

```bash
export SSH_GUARD_LLM_API_KEY="sk-or-v1-..."

guard server start --socket .cache/guard.sock &
guard config set-server .cache/guard.sock

# Allowed: routine inspection
guard run hostname
# guard-host

guard run ps aux
# USER  PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY STAT START   TIME COMMAND
# root    1  0.0  0.0   4624  3456 ?   Ss   10:00   0:00 /sbin/init

# Denied: destructive
guard run rm -rf /
# DENIED: Recursive deletion of root filesystem

# Denied: obfuscated attack
guard run bash -c 'eval $(echo cm0gLXJmIC8= | base64 -d)'
# DENIED: Base64-decoded payload piped through eval
```

When using `guard server connect` directly (rather than `guard run`), target
arguments are forwarded after the target binary:
`guard server connect --socket .cache/guard.sock df -h`.

### Safe mode

Safe mode allows visible, bounded administration while still blocking direct
credential-material reads and obvious escalation paths:

```bash
SSH_GUARD_MODE=safe guard server start --socket .cache/guard.sock &

# Allowed: ordinary inspection and work files
guard run cat /etc/hosts
# 127.0.0.1 localhost

guard run cp README.md .cache/readme-copy
# copied

# Denied: credential material
guard run cat /app/.env
# DENIED: Credential material read

# Still denied: privilege escalation
guard run sudo su
# DENIED: Escalation to root shell
```

### Paranoid mode for untrusted agents

Paranoid mode locks down to basic read-only inspection:

```bash
SSH_GUARD_MODE=paranoid guard server start --socket .cache/guard.sock &

# Allowed: basic system state
guard run id
# uid=1000(agent) gid=1000(agent) groups=1000(agent)

guard run df -h
# Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
# /dev/sda1       100G   45G   55G  45% /

# Denied: file reading
guard run cat /etc/passwd
# DENIED: File reading blocked in paranoid mode

# Denied: environment inspection
guard run env
# DENIED: Environment variable dump blocked in paranoid mode
```

### Static deny policy

For fast-reject of known-bad patterns without an LLM call, add a static deny policy:

```bash
guard server start --policy examples/deny-policy.yaml --socket .cache/guard.sock &
```

Static patterns are checked first. If a command matches a deny pattern, it is rejected immediately without an LLM call. Commands that pass static policy are then evaluated by the LLM.

See [`examples/deny-policy.yaml`](examples/deny-policy.yaml) for a reference policy with documented limitations of static glob matching.

### Custom system prompt

Replace the built-in prompt entirely for a specific deployment:

```bash
guard server start --system-prompt /etc/guard/my-prompt.txt --socket .cache/guard.sock &
```

Or place a prompt file at `~/.config/guard/system-prompt.txt` to override automatically.

### Additive prompt

Append environment-specific instructions to the built-in prompt without replacing it:

```bash
# Via CLI flag
guard server start --system-prompt-append /etc/guard/extra-rules.txt &

# Or via environment variable
SSH_GUARD_PROMPT_APPEND=/etc/guard/extra-rules.txt guard server start &
```

Example additive prompt (`extra-rules.txt`):

```
Additional rules for this environment:

- This server runs a PostgreSQL database. Allow SELECT queries via psql but deny DROP, DELETE, or TRUNCATE.
- The /opt/app directory contains the application. Allow reads but deny writes.
- Allow docker ps and docker logs but deny docker exec, docker run, and docker rm.
```

The additive prompt is appended to whichever base prompt is active (readonly, safe, paranoid, or custom), letting operators customize behavior without maintaining a full prompt fork.

## Session grants

Session grants hand a specific agent narrow extra permissions for a specific run, without relaxing the global mode. The agent identifies its session by the `GUARD_SESSION` env var; every `guard run` (and `guard server connect`) reads that env var and forwards it as the session token in the request. Operators attach allow/deny patterns and prompt context to that token.

The simplest flow is `guard session new`, which mints a token and (optionally) grants it in one round trip, printing an eval-friendly export line:

```bash
# Operator: mint a session, grant it, capture the token in the current shell
eval "$(guard session new \
  --allow 'mkdir /tmp/job-42*' \
  --allow 'rm /tmp/job-42/scratch*' \
  --prompt 'This session is preparing /tmp/job-42 as scratch space.' \
  --ttl 3600)"

# Now any agent launched from this shell inherits GUARD_SESSION
claude
# or
GUARD_SESSION="$GUARD_SESSION" my-agent
```

Inside the agent's process tree, every `guard run` call automatically picks up `GUARD_SESSION` from the inherited environment, so the model itself does not need to know or pass the token explicitly — it is bound to the shell that launched the agent.

To grant rules to an existing token (e.g. one the agent already has):

```bash
guard session grant <token> --allow '<glob>' --deny '<glob>' [--ttl N] [--prompt TEXT]
```

Matching deny patterns win over allow patterns, and everything that does not match a session rule falls through to the normal evaluator. Grants live in server memory and clear on daemon restart. `guard session revoke <token>` is daemon-UID-only; `guard session list` is visible over the Unix socket to exec-allowed local users, but it redacts the bearer token, rule bodies, and prompt text unless the caller is the daemon UID.

## Per-run secret injection

`guard run` can request stored secrets for one approved command without requiring a shim or persistent tool config. The daemon resolves the secret values immediately before exec, injects them into the child environment, and includes those values in exact-match output redaction.

`guard secrets add/list/remove` are Unix-socket-only, per-user operations. Any exec-allowed local user can manage their own secret namespace; TCP clients cannot use secret storage or `--secret`, because the namespace is keyed from Unix peer credentials. When the daemon UID runs `guard secrets list`, it gets an aggregate names-only view across every UID namespace; duplicate key names can appear more than once and are intentionally not annotated with ownership in the default list output.

For daemon-side migration and cleanup, use `guard secrets list --detailed` as the daemon UID. That view includes `uid=` for namespaced entries and `origin=legacy` for pre-namespace flat secrets that still need operator migration.

Upgrade note: pre-namespace flat secrets are no longer served through normal per-user `guard secrets list` / `guard run --secret` paths. Migrate them before rollout:

- `pass`: move `guard/<key>` to `guard/u<uid>/<key>`
- `env`: rename `GUARD_SECRET_<KEY>` to `GUARD_SECRET_U<uid>_<KEY>`
- `local`: rewrite the flat YAML `{ KEY: value }` into `{ <uid>: { KEY: value } }`

After migration, verify with `guard secrets list` as the target user and `guard run --secret KEY ...`.

For a stored secret with a shell-safe name, `--secret NAME` injects `$NAME`:

```bash
guard run \
  --secret OPNSENSE_API_KEY \
  --secret OPNSENSE_API_SECRET \
  --secret OPNSENSE_USERNAME \
  ssh opnsense-host 'configctl system status'
```

For a stored secret with dashes, slashes, or lowercase names, bare `--secret` derives an uppercase env var by replacing separators with underscores:

```bash
guard run --secret opnsense-apikey-secret \
  sh -c 'opnsense-tool --key "$OPNSENSE_APIKEY_SECRET"'
```

Map a different environment variable name to a stored secret key with `ENV_VAR=secret-name`:

```bash
guard run --secret OPNSENSE_API_KEY=atlas/opnsense-apikey ssh opnsense-host uptime
```

Plain per-run environment values are also supported for non-secret settings:

```bash
guard run --env OPNSENSE_HOST=opnsense-host --secret OPNSENSE_API_KEY \
  sh -c 'ssh "$OPNSENSE_HOST" uptime'
```

## Admin authorization

Session admin RPCs (`session new` / `grant` / `revoke`, plus the privileged subset of `status`) are restricted to **the daemon's own UID**. `session list` is the exception: exec-allowed local Unix-socket callers may see that grants exist, when they were granted, and when they expire, but the daemon redacts the session token, allow/deny patterns, and prompt text unless the caller is the daemon UID. There is no client-side admin token, by design — without that separation, any exec-allowed UID could mint a session whose `--prompt` tells the model to approve everything, a trivial bypass.

The non-privileged `guard status` (run as your normal user or any other exec-allowed UID) returns only client + server version, uptime, evaluation mode, and dry-run state. It is a liveness probe — enough to confirm the connection works and what mode the evaluator is in, but nothing that would help fingerprint the deployment or escalate privilege.

The `--prompt` / `--prompt-file` flags attach a free-form context fragment that is appended to the LLM system prompt under a `Session context:` heading for evaluator calls made under that token. Use them for guidance the static glob patterns cannot express. The decision cache is bypassed when a session prompt is in play, because cached verdicts were made under the base prompt and may not hold under the extended context.

## Agent integration

Point your agent's command execution at `guard run` instead of direct execution.

### MCP server

Guard can run as a stdio MCP server so agents call a tool instead of shelling out:

```bash
guard config set-server ~/.guard/guard.sock
guard mcp serve
```

The server exposes a `guard_run` tool:

```json
{
  "binary": "ps",
  "args": ["aux"]
}
```

Optional per-call environment and secret references mirror `guard run`:

```json
{
  "binary": "sh",
  "args": ["-lc", "[ -n \"$OPNSENSE_APIKEY_SECRET\" ] && echo set"],
  "secrets": ["opnsense-apikey-secret"],
  "secretEnv": {
    "OPNSENSE_API_KEY": "atlas/opnsense-apikey"
  },
  "env": {
    "TARGET_HOST": "opnsense-prod"
  }
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "allowed": true,
  "reason": "Read-only process listing",
  "exit_code": 0,
  "stdout": "USER  PID ...",
  "stderr": null
}
```

Denied commands return a normal MCP tool result with `allowed: false` and the denial reason. Transport or daemon failures still use `isError: true`.

## Security model

Guard provides defense in depth through three layers:

1. **Environment isolation** (`env_clear`): Child processes inherit only safe environment variables (`PATH`, `HOME`, `USER`, `LANG`, `TERM`, etc.) plus any per-run or tool-configured variables the caller explicitly requested.

2. **Output redaction**: Known secret values (API keys, auth tokens, tool secrets, per-run injected secrets) are exact-match redacted from stdout/stderr before returning to the agent. Regex patterns catch `*_TOKEN`, `*_KEY`, `*_SECRET`, `*_PASSWORD`, PEM blocks, and JWTs.

3. **LLM evaluation**: Each command is analyzed for destructive intent, privilege escalation, reverse shells, obfuscated payloads, tool side-channel abuse, and prompt injection. The LLM evaluates the full command including all chained parts.

## Audit logging

Guard logs all decisions via `tracing`. Configure log level with `RUST_LOG`:

```bash
RUST_LOG=info guard server start    # decisions + token usage
RUST_LOG=debug guard server start   # verbose request/response logging
```

LLM token usage is logged per evaluation:

```
[LLM_USAGE] model=openai/gpt-5.4-nano attempt=1 prompt_tokens=3594 completion_tokens=47 total_tokens=3641 status=ok
```

## Limitations

- **Not a sandbox.** Guard is a policy gate, not an isolation boundary. Defense-in-depth (seccomp, read-only FS, restricted users, network segmentation) is still needed for adversarial environments.
- **No interactive sessions.** Agents get command execution only.
- **LLM latency.** Each command adds ~0.5-2s for the LLM call.
- **Fail-closed.** If the LLM call fails or returns unparseable output, the command is denied.
