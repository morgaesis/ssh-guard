//! Container hardening profile generation (seccomp, AppArmor) for guard

//!
//! These are conservative starting points an operator adapts to their host.
//! They confine the daemon without breaking its legitimate operation: guard
//! spawns operator-approved child commands, makes TLS calls to the LLM provider,
//! and reads/writes its own state and credential directory. The profiles bound
//! the filesystem reach and remove container-escape / host-tampering syscalls
//! while leaving that legitimate operation intact.

/// Syscalls a guard container never needs and that enable container escape,
/// kernel tampering, or host reconfiguration. Blocking them is safe for the
/// daemon and its child commands while removing the most dangerous primitives.
/// This is intentionally a denylist over a default-allow base, so the daemon and
/// arbitrary approved child binaries keep working; only clearly-dangerous
