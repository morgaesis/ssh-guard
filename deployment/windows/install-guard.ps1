.SYNOPSIS
    Deploy the `guard` consequence-gating daemon on Windows as a bypass-resistant
    Windows service.

.DESCRIPTION
    Installs guard as a Windows service that runs under the virtual service
    account `NT SERVICE\guard`. That account is the operator/daemon principal:
    it owns the named-pipe transport, the SQLite state database, the verb
    catalog, and the brokered kubeconfig. The interactive logged-in user (who
    runs AI agents) is a different, non-admin Windows principal and is therefore
    structurally unable to:

      1. Approve / deny / confirm / revert its own gated commands. The daemon's
         `validate_admin` (src/server.rs) only accepts an admin RPC when the
         connecting peer's SID equals the daemon's own SID. The agent connects
         to the pipe as its own SID, which is NOT the guard SID, so every
         `guard approve|deny|confirm|revert` it issues is refused. Only a caller
         running AS `NT SERVICE\guard` is accepted as the operator.

      2. Read the brokered credentials (the guard-only kubeconfig) or read/forge
         the daemon state (state.db). The data directory ACL grants FULL only to
         the guard SID, SYSTEM, and Administrators, and explicitly removes Users,
         Authenticated Users, and Everyone. A non-admin agent opening state.db or
         the kubeconfig gets ACCESS_DENIED from the kernel — it cannot read a
         brokered secret and cannot write a forged "approved" row to flip a held
         command into an executed one.

    The single trust boundary is Windows account isolation enforced by:
      * the named-pipe SID check in the daemon (operator identity), and
      * the NTFS DACL on C:\ProgramData\guard (state + credential confidentiality).

    Because creating or running a scheduled task AS a service account requires
    Administrator rights, the non-admin agent cannot fabricate the operator path
    either: the only way to act as `NT SERVICE\guard` from a console is through an
    elevated (UAC) action, which the agent cannot self-grant.

.NOTES
    Run from an elevated PowerShell for any action that changes system state
    (install, uninstall, approve, deny, confirm, revert). `status`,
    `provisionals`, and `approvals` are read-only and run as the current user.

    Guard CLI flags used here are the only ones that exist (verified against
    src/main.rs clap definitions):
      server start --socket <name> --gate consequence --state-db <path>
                   --verbs <path> --service [--no-llm]
      approve|deny|confirm|revert <handle> --socket <name>
      provisionals --socket <name>
      approvals [<handle>] --socket <name>
      config set-server <name>

    <#
        Run a guard action AS the operator (NT SERVICE\guard) via a transient
        scheduled task, and return its captured stdout/stderr.

        WHY a scheduled task: the daemon accepts an admin RPC only from a peer
        whose SID equals the guard SID. The operator therefore has to RUN the
        guard client process under the guard account. Windows lets you run a
        process as a virtual service account only through the Task Scheduler (or
        a service), and CREATING/RUNNING such a task requires Administrator. That
        is the whole point: the non-admin agent cannot create or run this task,
        so it cannot reach the operator gate. The human operator triggers this
        from an elevated console (a UAC prompt), which the agent cannot self-grant.

        Output capture: schtasks does not return a task's stdout. We wrap the
        guard invocation in a cmd.exe redirect to a file UNDER the ACL'd data
        directory (so only operator/admin can read it), run the task, wait for it
        to finish, read the file back, then delete both the file and the task.

        UNVERIFIED ON A LIVE HOST: running a task whose principal is a virtual
        service account, and the exact RunLevel/working-dir behavior of the
        redirect, need elevated testing. See the report.
